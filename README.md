I'm happy to share that I just finished another Power BI practice project and I learned more than I expected
Thank you Mo Chen for his YouTube tutorial that I used as a hands-on practice project - Sales Performance dashboard for Plan Co.. While the original idea came from YouTube, I rebuilt the dashboard myself to revisit core Power BI concepts and strengthen my data visualization thinking

This dashboard provides an overview of Sales, Quantity, and Gross Profit, where Gross Profit represents the company's profit after deducting COGs.

**Key insights from this practice project:
- Top 10 Countries (YTD vs PYTD - left panel):
This view compares Year-to-Date performance with Previous Year-to-Date to highlight which countries are improving or declining year over year. It helps quickly identify markets that need attention or further investment.
- Monthly Performance by Product (center waterfall):
This visual shows how Sales/Quantity/Gross Profit change month by month across products, clearly illustrating increases and decrease that contribute to overall performance.
- Product Type Trend Analysis (right chart)
A monthly comparison across product types allowing stakeholders to understand seasonality and product mix performance.
- Account Profitability Segmentation (scatter plot):
Account are segmented based on Gross Profit % and YTD Value, with average reference lines added. This will make easier to distinguish.

**Business recommendations based on this analysis:
- Focus strategies on high value, high profit accounts, as they contribute the most sustainable value such as Brazil, Philippines and Portugal which are have significant stand-out Gross Profit with others
- Review pricing and cost structures for high-sales but low GP% accounts to improve profitability.
- Investigate countries with declining PYTD performance to identify whether the issue lies in pricing, demand, or product mix.

Overall, this project helped me refresh essential Power BI skills and thoughtful visual design while also reinforcing how important it is to tell a clear business story, not just build charts.
